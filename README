This is a program to layer multiple images and the lighter(brighter) pixel gets to take perfernce,

I am mainly creating this for when I get around to taking star shots with my camera, and using this to create star trails.

I will be using PHP and the GD library

The following functions will be required:

to get the image height
 int imagesy ( resource $image )

to get the image width
 int imagesx ( resource $image )

to get the pixel color at specified point.
 int imagecolorat ( resource $image , int $x , int $y )

to set the "final" pixel	
 bool imagesetpixel ( resource $image , int $x , int $y , int $color )


I will then loop through the images in the folder, and loop through the pixels in the image, then cat the 'brightest' pixels to a final image, that will either be specified as output.jpg, or the specified filename by CLI switch -o


The main idea of this script will be to get <input folder> <output file>
get first image, get width and height
then loop through every pixel width first then height, and check them with the 'source' image, and the 'output image' whichever is 'brighter' (has a larger number) will be written to the 'output' image. the loop will then move on.

yes this is not the most effecient design, but I could always open every image into an array then loop through each pixel from every image in the array, and then check it.
But I dont want to hammer the ram that much...
